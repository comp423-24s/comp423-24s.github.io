<h2 id="course-schedule-structure">Course Schedule Structure</h2>
<p>This structure of this course is inspired by summer software engineering internships at leading companies. The course is divided into two halves. The first eight weeks are a full-stack “bootcamp” where you will read and complete official on-line tutorials for each of the primary layers of our technology stack (frontend, backend, and database). After each tutorial, you will partner with a classmate to build a small, canned feature in our course’s codebase in order to apply what you have learned. We progress our way through the stack from frontend to backend while learning collaborative best practices (pair programming, pull requests and code review, and so on).</p>
<p>In the second half of the semester, teams of four are formed. Each team chooses from a list of vaguely specified feature ideas, or may propose their own ideas. A one-week design sprint is followed by three two-week sprints spent specifying, implementing, documenting, and deploying your team’s feature. At the end of a sprint, each team presents brief progress demos to two other teams in class. In lieu of a final exam, final project presentations are given during the final exam period. Each team will present their feature to three other teams and the course staff; evaluation rubrics are filled out by presentation viewers and incorporated into the final project grade.</p>
<p>A stretch goal of this course is to merge the best implemented, documented, and tested feature into the production CSXL web application each semester. This has successfully occurred in the past, with some modifications and improvements needed after the course ended. For a full list of former COMP423 students whose code has been merged in, see the <a href="https://github.com/unc-csxl/csxl.unc.edu/graphs/contributors">Github Project’s Contributor’s Page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="modality-in-person">Modality: In-person</h2>
<p>The most valuable resources in this course are lecture and office hours. Both will be held exclusively in-person; remote participation in lecture is not feasible due to the emphasis on groupwork.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the courses in the computer science curriculum, Software Engineering is as much, or more, about interpersonal communication and the methodologies of collaboration as it is about programming and the mastery of neatly defined concepts and skills. You will be working in pairs and teams throughout the semester. Your ability to be an upstanding teammate is critical to your success in this course.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements-and-policies">Course Requirements and Policies</h2>
<p>You should attend all lectures and check the course page for announcements and updates. You should complete all assignments on time.</p>
<p>Please show up at least five minutes early to lecture so class can begin promptly at its scheduled start time. Please place your bookbag in the basket beneath your seat.</p>
<h2 id="course-load-expectation">Course Load Expectation</h2>
<p>This course is a rigorous introduction to Software Engineering. Communicating with your team mates, reading, designing, self-teaching, and debugging will require significant amounts of time every week. The amount of time you and your team mates spend engaging with course content and projects outside of lecture will significantly impact what you get out of this course. You should expect to spend 3 hours per week in lecture alongside 9 hours per week <em>outside of lecture</em> working on the course.</p>
<p>We DO NOT recommended taking COMP423 in a semester when you are enrolled in 17 or more credit hours.</p>
<h2 id="grading-criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>To do well in this course you must actively participate in lecture, be a professional, responsible, and productive team mate, keep up with the reading, writing, and programming assignments, and produce quality software.</p>
<p>Peer evaluations of each team member’s individual contributions to the final project will be heavily factored into final grade determinations. If you do not equitably contribute as a team mate in pair work on exercises and team work on the final project, which together represent 60% of your course grade, you may fail the course despite succeeding in the other components.</p>
<p>Final grades are calculated with the following weights for each course component:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% - Project Sprints / Final Project
<ul>
<li>10% for each of 3x Sprints</li>
<li>10% for Final Project Presentations and Final Project Hand-in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>40% - Homework
<ul>
<li>20% - Exercises</li>
<li>20% - Readings &amp; Professional Development</li>
</ul></li>
<li>15% - Assessments
<ul>
<li>5% - 3x In-Class Midterms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>5% - Attendance and In-class Participation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="class-attendance-policy">Class Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Our course adheres to UNC’s official policies on <a href="https://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/attendance-grading-examination/">Attendance, Grading, and Examination</a>.</p>
<p>Each student is permitted to be absent for up to four (4) lecture meetings without any penalty, prior approval, or instructor notification, regardless of absence type (university approved or otherwise). After four missed lectures, absences will count against your in-class activities and participation grade unless they are university approved absences.</p>
<h3 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h3>
<p>Regrade requests for quizzes and other manually graded assignments are open for 48 hours following the release of the grade. If you missed any of the points on a given assignment, review your work when grades are posted and understand the marks you missed. This will raise your comprehension and mastery of the material. In the event we grade your work improperly, select the specific question on Gradescope and submit a regrade request. If there are multiple questions, submit one request per question. Do not use regrade requests to ask why something is wrong, come work with us in office hours to understand the problem at hand.</p>
<h3 id="late-policies">Late policies</h3>
<p>All lecture assignments will be due by the end of lecture and handed-in on Gradescope.</p>
<p>All assignments, outside of assessments such as quizzes and the final, will have an 11:59pm deadline on their due date.</p>
<p>Assignments with 11:59pm deadlines will have late periods. When the late period begins, there is a 1-hour grace period in which no penalty is applied. A 15% late penalty will be applied at the end of the semester. The late period for assignments is 48-hours.</p>
<h4 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h4>
<p>To ensure fairness to everyone, as emergencies may arise for anyone, we will drop penalties on up to four late assignments. Priority will go to assignments weighted higher (e.g. exercises ahead of readings). <strong>This penalty drop does <em>not</em> impact zeroes, only penalties for assignments handed in late. We expect you to hand everything in!</strong></p>
<h3 id="grading-scale-breakdown">Grading Scale Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>A: 93-100</li>
<li>A-: 90-92</li>
<li>B+: 87-89</li>
<li>B: 83-86</li>
<li>B-: 80-82</li>
<li>C+: 77-79</li>
<li>C: 73-76</li>
<li>C-: 70-72</li>
<li>D: 60-69</li>
<li>F: 59 or below</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases of fractional points, grades will be rounded up if greater than 0.4999999999…</p>
<h3 id="office-hour-expectations">Office Hour Expectations</h3>
<p>All of our office hours are held <strong>in-person in Sitterson Hall</strong>. The up-to-date office hours schedule will be available on CourseCare.</p>
<p>To ensure that all the UTA staff is able to help students get the help they need, we have instituted the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>UTAs will help individual students with <strong>one ticket</strong> for up to a maximum of <strong>20 minutes per day</strong>. This limit ensures that more students have access to UTA help and ensures that UTA help does not impede your own learning and self-discovery working through problems on your own or with your teammates. Reasoning critically through problems and working with teammates to discover solutions is not only a valuable skill to develop, but it also makes you a better software engineer, team member, and problem solver.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, we expect that students write their CourseCare help tickets <strong>thoughtfully</strong>. Please explain the problem you are having in detail, and what you first tried to fix it. We will help you make progress on the problem you specify in the ticket, but will encourage you to try to reason through other problems if they come up before returning to office hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-project-presentations">Final Project Presentations</h3>
<p>This course centers around a large final project. In lieu of a final exam, we will still meet on the scheduled day of finals, but each group will give group presentations and demonstrations of their feature work completed in the back half of this semester.</p>
<h3 id="final-project-licensing-agreement">Final Project Licensing Agreement</h3>
<p>The final project of this course is to work in a team of four on implementing a feature for an MIT Licensed open source software project that serves the students in the Computer Science Department at UNC-Chapel Hill. The hope for final projects is to select the best implemented, documented, and tested features produced by teams in this course and merge them into the production software’s code base for you and future UNC-Chapel Hill computer science students to benefit from. As such, the implementation work you and your team does will be subject to a popular open source license, the MIT License <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" class="uri">https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>. Of course, per the license, any works merged in will record proper attribution and authorship in recognition of your contributions.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code-and-collaboration-policy">Honor Code and Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>Software Engineering is as at least as much, but typically more, about collaboration as it is about individual production. This course will emphasize technical collaboration, team work, community building, and leadership. Group work with peer students enrolled in the course and collaboration with course staff is encouraged unless made explicit otherwise (such as on quizzes and individual projects). The most significant graded portion of this course will be a group-based project.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration on submitted work in this course should cite all collaborators clearly and distinctly.</strong></p>
<p>Any code snippets, derivations, or generated code found or produced through artificial intelligence tools outside of the official documentation for a language, framework, or package, and made use of in your work, should be clearly cited and linked back to with a complete URL. <strong>You must understand and be able to explain any code snippet, derivation, or generated code you make use of in your work.</strong> For example, you do not need to cite an example usage found in the official documentation of an open source package imported into a project. However, you do need to cite an example usage found in StackOverflow, generated through ChatGPT, Github Co-pilot, or similar sources.</p>
<h3 id="code-review-test">Code Review Test</h3>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to, at any time, ask you to submit to a “code review” test with me or a TA. We may ask you to meet to explain any line of code or decision made in your program.</p>
<p><strong>Using code, even if cited, that you do not understand and cannot explain is intellectually dishonest and a lost learning opportunity for you.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, you should be able to comfortably explain the code you hand in for credit. Should you be unable to do so, your grade will be penalized for the assignment in question and you may be taken to honor court depending on the severity of the infraction.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>If you have suggestions on how to improve the course or just want to leave some positive, encouraging feedback for the TAs or I, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQMteEvnQpBfGsAYP5TpuqokQenhZUIf8CNvfAUUZEjMCWZQ/viewform" target="_blank">give us feedback</a>. If you make a suggestion we’re able to act on, while we still have time to, we’re more than happy to!</p>
<h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>The instructor and the undergraduate teaching assistant team value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. We broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. We strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve; we appreciate suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="title-ix-resources">Title IX Resources</h2>
<p>Any student who is impacted by discrimination, harassment, interpersonal (relationship) violence, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, or stalking is encouraged to seek resources on campus or in the community. Please contact the Director of Title IX Compliance (Adrienne Allison – <a href="mailto:Adrienne.allison@unc.edu" class="email">Adrienne.allison@unc.edu</a>), Report and Response Coordinators in the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office (<a href="mailto:reportandresponse@unc.edu" class="email">reportandresponse@unc.edu</a>), Counseling and Psychological Services (confidential), or the Gender Violence Services Coordinators (<a href="mailto:gvsc@unc.edu" class="email">gvsc@unc.edu</a>; confidential) to discuss your specific needs.
